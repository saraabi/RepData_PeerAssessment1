## Loading and preprocessing the data
1. Load the data

```{R echo=TRUE}
activity_data <- read.csv("Documents/data/activity.csv")

```

2. 


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

```{R}
steps <- as.numeric(as.vector(activity_data$steps))
sum(steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```
2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{R}
hist(steps)
```
3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{R}
mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?


```{R}
activity_interval <- aggregate(activity_data$steps,by=activity_data[3],FUN=mean,na.rm=TRUE)
x = activity_interval$interval
y = activity_interval$x
plot(x,y, type="l")
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
